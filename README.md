## <a name="general-information"></a>General Information
Poems by Kids is a large dataset of poems written and submitted by children in grades 1-5 (taken from a larger dataset from grades 1-12).  It is an important data set because historically, child language studies have been stymied by the small number of data sets available containing texts written by children.  It also plays a larger role in the context of emotion research and child development research.

## <a name="analysis"></a>Analysis
This was a really fun data set to explore.  My analysis included gender demographics, emotion content of poems by grade level, emotion intensity exploration, character count exploration, the Top 5 most intense poems categorized as Joy compared to the Top 5 most intense poems categorized as Anger, and a deep dive into a few commonly used words such as 'mom', 'cat, 'friend' and 'school'.
